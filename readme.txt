LCDSmartie + matrixorbital didn't worked for me. So, I made my own plugin & sketch for arduino!!!


hardware:	use provided arduino sketch & diagram
		

installation: 
		put "gen_crownsoft_lcd.dll" file into winamp plugin directory
		put "lcd_analyzer.ini" file into C: drive
		edit "lcd_analyzer.ini" file ( set port,baud rate etc...)
		run winamp!
